# SPR 13301412 Right-wing pull #1 (elections 1931); L=7, D=6 (arbitrary value by Smoggy)
# SPR 13301413 Changes creates tension!
# SPR 13301414 Right-wing pull #2 (start of Black 2 Years, 1933);  (arbitrary value by Smoggy)
# SPR 13301415 Right-wing pull #3; CEDA comes to power! (end of 1934); (arbitrary value by Smoggy)
# ----- *Smoggy's explanation of 'Right-wing pull': it was required to have events that pulled Spain to the right so the Spanish Union (Left wing radical and future communist block) did not occur before the historical elections by normal AI means. These events may not lead to accurate historical ministers, but is to lead to the  Confederation of the Autonomous Right coming to power. NOTE: There was no minister changes implemented; for historical accuracy, the events should have minister changes representing the resulting government if possible. Additional events may be needed for a better historical representation. Ahistorical options should also be developed in the future if possible or needed.
